Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  - The Gaming Room was a company that was looking to expand their already established gaming platform 'Draw It or Lose It' to three different operating systems (Linux, Mac, and Windwos) as well as mobile platforms and wanted to see if we could develop for these platforms and what was the pros and cons for each.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  - What I did particular well was researching the different operating systems and breaking it down in a manner that the customer would be able to choose which system they wanted to focus on. By providing this information, we are able to determine which operating system and approach meets their parameters.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  - The structure and organization of the design helped me understand what information I needed to provide and how I should break it down in order for the client to see the different options as well as the pros and cons of each.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  - For me, I would like to revise all of it and find a better way to improve upon the information that I'm provding.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - I took the information that was provided and tailored it to the needs of the customer. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing due to them understanding what direction that they want to go with their platform. By not following those basic guidelines, you could potential waste a great deal of time or money when working on the projected which would ultimatley make you lose credibility.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  - I approched the designing software by doing a lot of research on the different platforms and the pros and cons that are associated with them. By doing this, it provided me with a broader understanding of how these operating systems works and allowed me to provide the users with a educated guess on what path we would need to take in order to meet their needs.
